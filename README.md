# Life-HS

My implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Haskell

## To Use

```
stack build
stack exec Life <program/path>
```

Two example programs are included in the `programs/` folder. You can also
append a custom paint delay (in microseconds) to the run command. The default
paint delay is 100000.
